# Emotion categorization from images of faces 

Repository containing code and materials for my Ph.D. dissertation. 

***Last update***: 10/18/2021

**affectnet-split-images/**: images depicting one of the six so-called basic emotions (Happiness, Fear, Anger, Disgust(aversion), Surprise, Sadness), plus "neutral" faces, and faces with uncategorized emotions. Images are split by gender (Male/Female), and age (Adult/Minor). The images come from the [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/) dataset. 

**data**: data was obtained via an online survey asking participants to either (1) select one of 7 predetermined response choices ("forced-choice condition/survey");  or (2) freely naming images with up to three distinct words ("free-choice condition/survey")

**notebooks**: exploratory data analysis segmented by expected emotion, and the actual response in the surveys.
